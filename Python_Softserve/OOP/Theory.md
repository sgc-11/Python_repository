# Object Oriented Orientation

* Everything in python is an object

**Objective**: Writing reusable code, along with abstracting domain concepts.

## Basic principles
* Abstraction
    * Abstracting attributes from an object.
* Inheritance
    * Process of creating a new class based on an existing one without modifying it.
* Encapsulation
    * Hiding the private details of a class from other objects.
* Polymorphism
    * A concept of using common operations in different ways for different data input.
